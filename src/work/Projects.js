    Click-Chord is an app project I undertook to learn about browser
    audio APIs. The app renders out clickable boxes that each trigger
    a different musical chord within the scale the user has selected.
    To provide users with enjoyable instrumentation to interact with,
    I used the Tone.js library, which converts HTML5's oscillator
    sounds into "synthesizer" tones. The Tone.js library also provided
    an API that allowed me to develop a "Rhythm Maker" interface that
    lets users build their own drum sequences to backdrop chord
    progressions they create. Alternatively, users can toggle this
    feature to a "Rhythm Player" that offers pre-built rhythms.`,

    description: `Indego is Philadelphia's bike-sharing program. Using the Indego Bike Pulse app, users can find the Indego bike stations closest to where they are currently located. These locations will appear on a Google map, with markers representing each station. When the markers are clicked, an info window expands from them, telling the user how many bikes and parking docs are currently available at that station. The user can also scroll through a side bar window containing information blocks that contain additional details about each station. To build this project, I used the Google Maps and Google Places APIs, Indego's public GeoJSON API, and the Open Weather Map API. The front-end relies entirely on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as jQuery.`,

    description: `For my capstone project in Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering immersive, I worked with a group to develop a mobile messaging app called Catify. To build this app, we used React Native and the Expo.io toolchain. Among my particular contributions to the project was developing UI using React Native, as well as Native Base and Expo libraries. I helped develop our app's navigation architecture, messaging interface, and photo-generation feature. I also integrated Redux into our application.`,
