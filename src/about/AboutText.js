export const bio = `Before learning software development, I was a marketer in the automotive industry. I educated customers about our company's products, helped them troubleshoot installation, and recorded feedback about their experience with our products. In this role, I gained insight about how technology can serve its users. While working beside the engineers at our company, I became interested in contributing to the development of something as useful as our products were to our customers. In my capacity as a marketer, I was using a lot of software on the web, such as Airtable and SurveyMonkey. I began to research what it took to build these kinds of programs, and I found HTML, CSS and JavaScript tutorials. I never looked back. After months of study, I got accepted into Fullstack Academy of Code, where I gained a solid software development foundation. Now I write front and back-end programs using JavaScript, Node, and Python.`
