and nothing hurt. -Kurt Vonnegut*\nWe are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. -Kurt Vonnegut*\nA purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved. -Kurt Vonnegut*\nI urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is. -Kurt Vonnegut*\nLike so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops. -Kurt Vonnegut*\nTrue humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less. -CS Lewis*\nYou can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me. -CS Lewis*\nWe are what we believe we are. -CS Lewis*\nFriendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: What! You too? I thought I was the only one. -CS Lewis*\nWhat happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up Like a raisin in the sun?... Or does it explode? -Langston Hughes*\nI have discovered in life that there are ways of getting almost anywhere you want to go, if you really want to go. -Langston Hughes*\nLike a welcome summer rain, humor may suddenly cleanse and cool the earth, the air and you. -Langston Hughes*\nHumor is laughing at what you haven't got when you ought to have it. -Langston Hughes*\nHold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly. -Langston Hughes*\nI've known rivers: I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. My soul has grown deep like the rivers. -Langston Hughes*\nYou don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. -John Green*\nWhat a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person. -John Green*\nWhat is the point of being alive if you don’t at least try to do something remarkable? -John Green*\nThis is so American, man: either make something your God and cosmos and then worship it, or else kill it. -David Foster Wallace*\nFor the heart, life is simple: it beats for as long as it can. Then it stops. - Karl Ove Knausgård*\nLife's a pitch, as the old woman said. She couldn't pronounce her 'b's. -Karl Ove Knausgård*\nWhy should you live in a world without feeling its weight? -Karl Ove Knausgård*\nThere is only one thing children find harder to hold back than tears, and that is joy. -Karl Ove Knausgård*\nWhat is a work of art if not the gaze of another person?  -Karl Ove Knausgård*\nIf I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain. -Emily Dickinson*\nSaying nothing sometimes says the most. -Emily Dickinson*\nForever is composed of nows. -Emily Dickinson*\nThe soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience. -Emily Dickinson*\nTruth is so rare, it is delightful to tell it. -Emily Dickinson*\nKeep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you. -Walt Whitman*\n...the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse. -Walt Whitman*\nTwenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. -Mark Twain*\nThose who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly. -John F. Kennedy*\nIt is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt*\nChallenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful. -Joshua J.

I’m frightened of the old ones. –John Cage*\nI would rather write 10,000 notes than a single letter of the alphabet. –Ludwig van Beethoven*\nThe music is not in the notes, but in the silence between. –Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart*\nImagination creates reality. –Richard Wagner*\nVictory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan. -John F.Kennedy*\nYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. —Harper Lee*\nThe mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one. —J.D.
